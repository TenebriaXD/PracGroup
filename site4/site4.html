<h3>Reasons why it benefits society</h3>

<ol>

<li>People can learn knowledge outside school</li>

<p2>According to Oxford, new research has suggested that time spent playing games is positively associated with well-being. Using industry data on time playing popular video games, the study shows that those who enjoyed playing were more likely to report positive wellbeing experience. 'Our findings show video games aren't necessarily bad for your health; there are other psychological factors which have a significant effect on a person's well-being', stated by Professor Andrew Przybylski, Director of Research at the Oxford Internet Institude. More than 3,270 players were surveyed and the findings were combined with objective behavioural data collected by the video game companies.</p2>
